# Review-CPS-2232-Mod
 # Important Note: The website doesn't work anymore. This was a reviewer for quizes and tests in my Data Structures class. I basically made a JS script that will simplify everything, give me answers so I can review faster and much more efficient. I mainly took this opportunity to challenge my scripting skills. Sad that the website is down and I couldn't find the new site.
